Hey there 
My first project is based on client server based where i use java mysql connector and embed in the vs code 
(How to install the java mysql connetor you must prefer to follow to the youtube video for this )
My Second project in this repository is based on the pyton language and project name is Home Rennovation Management 
Here you have to install the python mysql connector and pay attention when you enter the password for the mysql if any case you lost or forget, you have to install the whole workbench again.
